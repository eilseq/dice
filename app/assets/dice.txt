*Dice - Diffusion Based MIDI Transformer*  

Dice is a MIDI transformation tool that generates new rhythmic patterns by modifying selected MIDI notes. 

Live's Clip View -> Transform -> Dice

It embeds a custom diffusion model crafted process selected MIDI notes in a 16x16 grid, applying controlled reshaping of the pattern structure based on user-defined parameters. The result is a transformed MIDI sequence that preserves original music features and style.

How It Works

-> Select the MIDI notes you want to transform.Dice only affects selected notes in a clip. 
-> The device processes the MIDI steps starting from C1 in the first bar.
-> The transformation is based on a 16x16 time-step matrix, where each step represents a note in a structured grid.
-> The output can be tweaked using the Noise, Seed, and Threshold parameters.

Parameters

-> Noise (0.0 – 1.0): Controls the amount of randomness added to the input. Higher values introduce more variation.
-> Seed (Integer): Changes the transformation outcome for the same input. Each seed generates a unique variation.
-> Threshold (0.0 – 1.0): Sets the density of the output. Lower values retain more notes, while higher values filter out less prominent ones.

Using Dice

1. Select the MIDI notes in your clip that you want to transform.
2. Adjust Noise, Seed, and Threshold to shape the transformation.
3. Click Transform to generate a new pattern.
4. Iterate and tweak parameters to explore alternative patterns.

Installation

The transformation patch is already available in this Live set. To install Dice globally in your Ableton setup, move the Max Transformations files into:

User Library -> Midi Tools -> Max Transformations

This makes the device available in Live’s MIDI Transform section for easy access.

Tips for Creative Use

-> Use Seed to explore multiple transformations of the same input.
-> Apply Dice transformations multiple times for evolving patterns.
-> Combine with other MIDI tools for layered and complex sequences.
